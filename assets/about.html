    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>ShoppingList is an easy to use shopping list for Android.</p>
    <p>
        It tries to be "smart", and remembers how many times you have used an item, and
        in what order you pick up items in the store. This way it can present a list
        with items in the order that is most likely that the items will appear in the
        store.
